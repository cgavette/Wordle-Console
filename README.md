# Wordle-Console
C# console game that works that same as the New York Times Worlde game.
This is a console game that I made using visual studio and the integrted console that goes with it.
The program works by using 2 2D arrays to track the users guesses. The first array in a char-array that keeps track of the letters that the user has guessed. The second array is an int-array that assigns a values from 0-3 to each letter in the char array respectively, this values scales based on how close the user's guess was.
